- The pattern is to multiply the resulting letter placement (D is 4) by the number next to it (4)
to get the original letter placement (P is 16)
- It appears that the pattern is arbitrary as long as the math operation is true every time
    - if one of the factors is prime, then the possible encoding is more narrow
- QUADRANT
    - Q (17) = 17 * 1, 1 * 17 = Q1 or A17
    - U (21) = 7 * 3 = G3 or C7
    - A (1) = 1 * 1 = A1 - only option
    - D (4) = 2 * 2, 4 * 1 = B2, D1, or A4
    - R (18) = 9 * 2, 3 * 6, 1 * 18 = I2, B9, C6, F3, A18, or R1
    - A = A1
    - N (14) = 7 * 2, 1 * 14 = G2, B7, A14, or N1
    - T (20) = 5 * 4, 1 * 20, 2 * 10 = E4, D5, A20, T1, B10, or J2

- One possible encoding of QUADRANT: A17G3A1A4B9A1N1J2
- Without an additional encoding example, it's difficult to narrow down the exact pattern
